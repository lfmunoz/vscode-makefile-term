# vscode-makefile-term 

This extension allows you to run a `Makefile` `target` from within the
editor by clicking above the `target`. It will execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# note this is configurable
cd %makefileDir% make -f %file% %target%
```

* `%makefileDir%` - the directory of the Makefile that is being edited
* `%file%` - file where you clicked the TARGET
* `%target%`  - the text found using the following logic: 
  *  any line starting with an alphabeticnumeric string followed by a colon and not including `=`

Only the following place holders are available: `%target%`, `%makefileDir%`, `%file%`.  There is also a keybinding to run the previously clicked target again (default `Ctrl+Shift+x`)

## Extension Settings

See `package.json` for full available settings.

## Requirements

* Tested on vscode 1.65.0


## Known Issues

* Can increase performance with a cache (not a problem so far)
* The command template and the text template that is user defined use `replace` and not `replaceAll`. This means each variable can be replaced 1 or 0 times.
